Introduction

Machine translation, the task of automatically converting text from one language to another, has seen significant advancements with the advent of deep learning models. In this project, the objective is to explore and implement a machine translation system focusing specifically on translating between English and Chinese languages.

The project utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) as the core model. BERT, a state-of-the-art transformer-based language representation model, has demonstrated exceptional performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation.

The task at hand involves the development and training of a BERT-based model capable of understanding, processing, and generating accurate translations between English and Chinese texts. Given the complexities and nuances inherent in both languages, the goal is to achieve high-quality translations that preserve the original meaning, context, and nuances while ensuring grammatical correctness and fluency in the translated text.

Key procedures of this project are as follows, preprocessing and tokenization of English and Chinese text data to prepare it for BERT model input, fine-tuning the BERT model for machine translation specifically between English and Chinese languages, evaluating and benchmarking the performance of the machine translation system using established metrics such as BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score, accuracy, and fluency, exploring the impact of different BERT configurations, training strategies, and hyperparameters on translation quality, addressing challenges specific to English-Chinese translation, such as syntactic differences, word order, idiomatic expressions, and cultural nuances.

The successful implementation of an efficient and accurate machine translation system between English and Chinese holds immense practical value in breaking language barriers, facilitating cross-cultural communication, and aiding in various domains, including business, education, and global connectivity.

This report presents the methodologies, experiments, and findings from the development and evaluation of the BERT-based machine translation system, providing insights into its effectiveness, limitations, and potential improvements for future enhancements.
